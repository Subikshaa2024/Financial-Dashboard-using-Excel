* Customer Demographics
* Discounts and Profit
* Shipping Data
## Key features and Executions:
### Data Preparation and Data cleansing:
* Converted the range of cells into a table format for better data management and analysis.
* Ensured data types were correctly set and removed duplicate values to maintain data integrity.
### Pivot Tables and Dynamic Linking:
* Created multiple pivot tables on a separate sheet to summarize and analyze sales data.
* Linked pivot table cells to the dashboard sheet to enable dynamic updates based on slicer selections.
### Slicers and Timeline:
* Implemented slicers for Country and Discount Bands to allow users to filter data dynamically.
* Added a timeline slicer for date-based filtering, enabling users to view data for specific periods.
### Dashboard Elements:
* **Total Sales and Total Profit**: Displayed using pivot table summaries linked to the dashboard.
* **Most Profitable Product**: Arranged the profit column in the pivot table in descending order and linked the top product name to the dashboard.
* **Top Three Products**: Linked the respective cells in the pivot table according to their profit values in descending order to display the top three products.
* **Calculated Columns**: Created a calculated column in the pivot table for gross profit.
* **Combo Chart**: Introduced a combo chart to visualize manufacturing price and units sold as a line chart, with profit percentage as a trend line.
* **Bar Graph**: Displayed the quantity of products sold month-wise in a bar graph.
### Data visualization:
* Utilized various Excel chart types to create a visually appealing and informative dashboard.
* Ensured all visuals had meaningful titles and were formatted attractively to enhance readability and user engagement.
